I like Perl and doing webmaster stuff. My go-to Linux distro for general-purpose server stuff is Fedora. For desktop, archbtw :^)

I currently know a good amount of Perl, an okay amount of SQL and Lua, and am learning C and TADS3.

My personal projects will generally be at [my selfhosted Forgejo instance](https://git.pinegrove.xyz/nu) with them being mirrored here for visibility.
