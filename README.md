I like Perl and webshite and sysadmin but I'm not good at any of them â€” maybe sysadmin if you're being really really generous

My go-to Linux distros are Arch and Fedora for general prupose desktop and server stuff respectively

I currently know a decent amount of Perl and some SQL, trying to learn Lua and Crystal.

I learned Perl when I was decently young (like 11 or 12) and this has strongly influenced my opinions and preferences where programming languages are concerned. Sometimes this causes issues, like I get very frustrated by being forced into one programming paradigm by other languages I try to learn (usually OOP)

I mostly host stuff on [my own Gitea instance](https://git.pinegrove.xyz/nu). Any repos of mine you see here on Github that aren't forks are likely to be mirrors of repos from there for visibility purposes.
