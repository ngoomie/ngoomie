i'm ngoomie and i stink

I like Perl and webshite and sysadmin but I'm not good at any of them â€” maybe sysadmin if you're being really really generous

My go-to Linux distros are Fedora and Rocky Linux for general prupose desktop and server stuff respectively, and Debian or Devuan for "set and forget" type server stuff

I currently know a decent amount of Perl and some SQL, and am in the process of learning Python

I mostly host stuff on [my own Gitea instance](https://git.hyperboreal.zone/nu). Any repos of mine you see here on Github that aren't forks are likely to be mirrors of repos from there for visibility purposes.
