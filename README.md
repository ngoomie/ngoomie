i'm ngoomie and i'm STUPID

I like Perl and webshite and sysadmin but I'm not good at any of them â€” maybe sysadmin if you're being really really generous

My go-to server Linux distros are Fedora for general purpose stuff, Debian or Devuan for things I want to set up and largely "forget" about, and Alpine Linux for really lightweight junk

I don't really know what I'm supposed to put here because I am extremely uninteresting
